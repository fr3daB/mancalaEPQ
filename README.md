# mancalaEPQ
Virtual mancala game for Extended Project Qualification
The aim of the game is for the player to have the most stones in their bank or “mancala” which can be done by capturing opponents’  stones or by depositing their own stones in their mancala. The player chooses a deposit out of 6 to start from and drops one pebble in each successive hole until they run out. Extra turns can be earned in addition to the ability to capture an opponent’s stones which is what makes mancala a game of strategy rather than chance.

To run, please ensure the modules playsound and Pillow(PIL) are installed.
